# Babblio

(Work-in-progress) Babblio is a full-stack web application inspired by chat apps such as Discord and Slack. It lets users create servers for chatting. Every server can have many different channels. For example, the Music server could have a channel dedicated to learning the guitar, and users could use that channel to share tips on how best to learn it.

This project was implemented with a Ruby on Rails backend, using React.js and Redux. Live chat functionality was achieved using ActionCable websockets.
